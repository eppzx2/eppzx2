## 🚀 About Me

I am a cybersecurity student actively preparing for a career in penetration testing (Red Team). I focus on understanding how systems fail, how attackers think, and how security can be improved through automation and practical testing.

My learning approach is lab-driven and hands-on, with a strong emphasis on real-world attack scenarios rather than purely theoretical knowledge.
